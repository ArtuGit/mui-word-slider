# MUI Word Slider - GitHub Pages POC

A proof of concept demonstrating that static files can be successfully published and deployed on GitHub Pages with automatic CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as a **Proof of Concept (POC)** to demonstrate:

- ✅ Static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files can be deployed to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Modern, responsive web design with Material Design principles
- ✅ Interactive animations and smooth user experience
- ✅ HTTPS enabled by default
- ✅ Global CDN delivery for fast loading times

## 🚀 Live Demo

Once deployed, this site will be available at:

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Push to Repository**: Simply push your changes to the `main` or `master` branch
2. **GitHub Actions**: The workflow will automatically trigger and deploy your site
3. **Enable Pages**: Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings

### Manual Setup

1. **Repository Settings**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings → Pages
   - Select "GitHub Actions" as the source

2. **Enable Workflow**:
   - The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file will handle automatic deployment
   - Every push to main/master branch triggers a new deployment

3. **Custom Domain** (Optional):
   - Add a `CNAME` file with your custom domain
   - Configure DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages

## 🔧 Local Development

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/mui-word-slider.git
   cd mui-word-slider
   ```

2. **Open in browser**:
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local server like Live Server in VS Code

3. **Make changes**:
   - Edit HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files
   - Refresh browser to see changes
   - Push to GitHub for automatic deployment

## 📱 Responsive Design

The site is fully responsive and optimized for:

- **Desktop**: Full-width layout with hover effects
- **Tablet**: Adapted grid layout and touch-friendly interactions
- **Mobile**: Single-column layout with optimized typography

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors
The color scheme uses Material Design colors:
- Primary: `#1976d2` (Blue)
- Success: `#4caf50` (Green)
- Background: Gradient from `#667eea` to `#764ba2`

### Typography
- Font Family: `Roboto` (Google Fonts)
- Weights: 300, 400, 500, 700

### Animation Timing
- Word typing speed: 100ms per character
- Word erasing speed: 50ms per character
- Pause between words: 2 seconds

## 🔍 Browser Support

This POC supports all modern browsers:
- Chrome 60+
